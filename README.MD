# YouTube Playlist Backup

A simple Node.JS program that periodically downloads the titles of videos in a YouTube playlist and persists them somewhere else.

Frequently, YouTube videos get set to private or deleted. This means that they won't show up in playlists anymore. The only way to find what the name of the video was is to search for the URL in archive.org or the internet. Sometimes this won't return any results because the video wasn't shared anywhere or was up for not too long to be archived. 

To be able to find replacement videos for my playlists, I created this small tool.
